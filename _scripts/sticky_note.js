//TODO small indicator that embeds into an element. when you click on a child we search up to find a parent node with an ID and attach to that (if in a table)
//if no id is found in the parents then look at chldren and attach to an id there
// if no id is found either direction then attach to a tr or li

//maybe use title or alt text on a link or image?
