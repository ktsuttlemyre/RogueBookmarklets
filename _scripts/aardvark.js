    Aardvark is a developer toolset that was once an old Firefox extention now turned into a bookmarklet.
    - Clean up unwanted banners and surrounding "fluff," especially prior to printing a page
    - See how the page is created, block by block
    - View the source code of one or more elements
deprecated: Originally created in 2005 it doesn't seem to work as well at it once did as browsers have evovled a lot since then.
